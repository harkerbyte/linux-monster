  <p> <b>Migrate</b> : This should be the next thing you touch, incase you have decided to enable proxy. It interface is also made simple for users to comprehend, consider it a native proxy formatter.
  
  Trust me, only this can refactor your imported proxies to a format that main.py can understand and work with.</p>

  <p> <b>Server (unstable)</b> : This is specifically made for brute force attacks only when proxy is enabled. For the best performance, be sure you have provided migrate with premium proxies. Otherwise, you are likely to face proxy issues</p>

        Heavy : it consumes a massive amount of resources to keep its connections stable and accurate, which could lead to lag for low-end users, or even force quits.

      <td>
        Heavier : as the server has to run multiple requests, this could result in increased resource usage. This could overall ruin your relationship in case you never informed the other party beforehand.
